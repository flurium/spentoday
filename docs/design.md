# All about design

Pages, UX, ...

## Shop management

Pages:

- Product management
  - Product creation/editing
  - List of products to manage
  - Delete confirmation
  - Draft and published products
- Categories management (top categories I suppose)
- Contact form
- Informational pages like blog
- Orders history
- Reviews (shop, products)
- Subscribers
- Settings

## Functional part

Here is the list of websites, that small shops/businesses have.
They are quite awful, but they have basic functionality that shops probably want.
So if we provide much better experience and design by default, a lot of businesses
will switch to us:

- [makeup.com.ua](https://makeup.com.ua/) - actually not bad
- [helgamade.com.ua](https://helgamade.com.ua/ua/)
- [haliabaluvana.com](https://haliabaluvana.com/)
- [svit-chaju.ua](https://svit-chaju.ua/ru/)
